# Hey there, my name is Pedro!

I am a hands-on software architect / developer who enjoys both designing and developing complex applications. Worked with both small and big teams, always focusing on bringing value with the best development practices in mind.

Have knowledge on the whole software development cycle, including planning, implementation and testing. Worked on multiple types of projects: on-premise, cloud and migration projects. As an architect I have different responsibilities, but always value being close to the development team and always being able to understand the system.

Have experience on a range of technologies, developing C# / C++ / Java / Python / Angular applications, designing and creating distributed systems and I am able to work with multiple cloud providers like AWS and Azure.
